        "description": "This project is a word guess game where the user can use their keyboard to guess letters in the random word that is selected. This game is inspired by my favorite video game, Smite, and each word generated is a Smite character. I do NOT own any of the images in this web app. It was created for my own educational and recreational purposes. It really helped me understand how javascript functions within an html file. This project has been my favorite to work on so far in my web development journey. I hope you enjoy it as well!",

The goal of the game is to match your score to the given random number by clicking on the four crystals. Each time a crystal is clicked, the value of that crystal is added to the user's score. You lose the game if your score goes over the random number, and you win the game if your score exactly matches the random number.",

If the question is answered incorrectly, or if it is not answered within the time frame, the user does not get any points and the game automatically moves on to the next question. If the answer is correct, the user's score increases by a point. At the end of the game, the score is displayed for the user and a restart button appears, which allows the user to restart the game completely.",
